# Burger Recipe Collaboration and Merge Conflict Resolution Assessment

## Objective
The purpose of this assessment is to familiarize students with version control using GitHub, collaborative workflows, and the process of resolving merge conflicts.

## Scenario
Imagine you and your team are working on creating new burger recipes for a restaurant named VCS Burgers. To streamline collaboration and keep track of changes, you'll be using GitHub for version control.

## Instructions
#### You will need to take screenshots to document the process in step 6.
### Step 01: Create a Repository on GitHub (Owner)
1. Create a GitHub repository and give it an appropriate title, e.g., "Wonderburger."
2. Add all team members as collaborators to the repository.
3. Create a ingredients.md file and add the words "top bun" then add "bottom bun" below it.
4. Save, commit and Push to your main.

### Step 02: Branch, Modify, and Push (Each Team Member)
1. Each team member should create a **new branch** within the repository for their own changes. You can name the branches based on your   names or any other relevant identifier (e.g., alice-branch, bob-branch).
4. On your branch, each team member should also add a unique ingredient in the ingredients.md file and their name between the buns, eg. - Lettuce (added by Alice)
5. Save the changes and push them to the remote repository.


### Step 03: Create a Pull Request (Each Team Member)
1. Create a pull request (PR) directly from your **individual branch to the main branch.**
In the PR description, mention that you've added a unique ingredient and its placement to the ingredients.md file.
Merge conflicts are expected due to the concurrent changes from team members.

### Step 05: Resolve Merge Conflicts (Each Team Member for their main branch)
1. Review the PRs and identify any merge conflicts that arise due to overlapping changes.
2. Collaboratively resolve the merge conflicts, you mau discuss and the appropriate ingredients and their order.
3. Update the PR with the resolved conflicts.

### Step 06: Preventing Merge Conflicts
1. Documnet the process showing your branch of another persons repo, your repo(main) and the conflict resolution process you undertook in  file called conflict.md
2.  Describe in 20-50 words how a better workflow could have prevented the merge conflicts in the first place and add this to a new file called workflow.md in your repo.
