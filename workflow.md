# Preventing Merge Conflicts
### Workflow Outline

<scan style="color:darkgray">
Each ingredient should be on a new line. This prevents any conflicts from occuring, and allows for every ingredient to be merged instantly.
<br></br>
For every ingredient you include, please make sure to start your line with "-". This will prevent the lines from overlapping when displaying in Markdown.
